3. It is important to choose a license, because it will define how/ who will be able to profit (if at all) from some project. If a developer chooses to own and completely control their code, they will probably choose a proprietary license. Even in an open source project, choosing a license is important to define how consumers can reuse their project. Some licenses make modifiers use their code in another open source project, whereas other licenses, let people use their code wherever they want to.  
4. Projects that don't have an explicit license do not define what anyone can do with them. As someone who seeks to use that unlicensed code, one should be aware that the license could change at any time. Since the project is not licensed, the project owner could begin using a proprietary license and sue anyone who is depending on their code. The owner could also use an open source license that is incompatible with the licenses of those who depend on it, so everyone would have to rewrite a whole lot of code.  
5. The article claims that Gopher was unable to get enough open source support behind the project like the Web did, causing the project to fork itself to death. The article claims that Gopher by not adhering to open source in their licensing, charging for .com and not .edu, failed to get enough open source support for Gopher. I agree that, considering who would have been interested in the project at the time, trying to do something to the scope of Gopher was foolish. Especially because they were competing with the Web which had a much larger community, failure was inevitable.
6. Linux uses the GPL v2 license, because linux was always an alternative to other proprietary operating systems. GPL v2 prevents sublicenses, so it requires modifiers to also have an open source license. This makes sense, because linux has always been the most well known open source project and one of the most important for the open source movement.
